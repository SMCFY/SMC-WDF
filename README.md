# SMC-WDF
A Real-Time Wave Digital Filter Library for Matlab. The library provides the most basic WDF elements with the possibility for extensions. The library works in real-time and can be used to generate audio-plugins with Matlab's Audio System Toolbox.

SMC-WDF is created by [Jonas Holfelt](https://github.com/jholfelt), [Sohejl Zabetian](https://github.com/szbtn), [Aleix Claramunt Molet](https://github.com/aleixcm) and [Nikolaj Andersson](https://github.com/NikolajAndersson) during their 2nd semester at [Sound and Music Computing](https://github.com/SMC-AAU-CPH) at [Aalborg University Copenhagen](http://media.aau.dk/smc/).
